# KaggleLoanSuccess_MachineLearning
Getting first practice with machine learning models by experimenting on a "Loan Default Prediction Dataset" dataset form Kaggle. 

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil1e9/loan-default/code?datasetId=3725579&searchQuery=feature+en

## Scope
After completing machine learning courses on Coursera in the past I wanted to apply some of the theory in practice. In line with the scope of my search for internships, finance/risk related projects seemed logically. On Kaggle I found a dataset for predicting loan default cases. This projects scope is to get some practice with data science and machine learning libraries in Python, compare different ideas and to showcase structured approaching of such a problem. Finding explicitly a “perfect” solution in terms of accuracy was not my top priority.
